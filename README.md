# üåæ Real-Time Crop & Weed Detection Using YOLOV5

## üìå Abstract

Site-specific weed management and selective application of herbicides as eco-friendly techniques are still challenging tasks‚Äîespecially for densely cultivated crops like rice. This project aims to develop a real-time crop and weed detection system using a stereo vision camera setup and deep learning. It distinguishes between rice plants and weeds and classifies them using artificial neural networks optimized with metaheuristics (PSO and Bee Algorithm). It achieves **over 90% classification accuracy** on test sets, outperforming traditional classifiers like KNN.

## üß™ Materials and Methods

- **Study Region:** 5-hectare rice field in Karimnagar, Telagana , India.
- **Crops:** Rice (Tarom Mahali)
- **Weeds:** Narrow-leaf (e.g., *Echinochloa crus-galli*), Broad-leaf (e.g., *Alisma plantago-aquatica*)
- **Camera:** Fujifilm FinePix Real 3D-W3 stereo camera
- **Processing:** FFmpeg, MATLAB, YOLOv5

The stereo camera was mounted on a rail platform moving at 0.10 m/s. Data was collected in stereo video format, converted into frames, segmented using RGB thresholds,
and analyzed for color, texture, and shape features.

## üß† Deep Learning & Feature Optimization

- **Total Features Used:** 302 (color, texture, shape)
- **Feature Selection Algorithms:** 
  - Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)
  - Bee Algorithm (BA)
- **Classifier:** Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
- **Baseline Comparison:** K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- **Best Accuracy:** 92.02% (ANN + BA, Geometric Mean)
